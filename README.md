## Input data

We used Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) [(Johnson et al. 2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01899-x), a freely available data set to develop PADSthe model. The MIMIC-IV data set was collected from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, containing more than 70k critically ill patients who were admitted to critical care units. It contains patient demographics, vital signs, records of fluid and medication administration, results of laboratory tests, observations, and notes provided by care professionals. Access to MIMIC-IV is provided via [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.1/). The Institutional Review Board at the BIDMC granted a waiver of informed consent and approved the sharing of the research resource.

For this study, we excluded patients with stays shorter than 48 hours (by definition, the proposed models need at least 48 hours worth of data), and those with life support treatment limitation orders.

## Data preprocessing

All the required preprocessing is implemented in the pipeline. It includes:
- NaN imputation (see table below)
- Data normalization

Non-normal values are not checked in the preprocessing phase.

## Variables

The variables used by PADS are the following:


| Variable | Units | Value range | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|stay_id| - | - |The stay ID provided by MIMIC-IV|
|rate_epinephrine| mcg/kg/min | 0 - 4.64 ||
|rate_norepinephrine| mcg/kg/min | 0 - 21.19 ||
|rate_dopamine| mcg/kg/min | 0.2 - 1069.52 ||
|rate_dobutamine| mcg/kg/min | 0.1 - 40.22 ||
|meanbp_min| mmHg | 0.25 - 299 ||
|pao2fio2ratio_novent| - | 8 - 1706 ||
|pao2fio2ratio_vent| - | 1 - 2104 ||
|gcs_min| - | 3 - 15 ||
|bilirubin_max| mg/dL | 0.1 - 87.2 ||
|creatinine_max| mg/dL |  0.1 - 80 ||
|platelet_min| K/uL | 5 - 2360 ||
|admission_age| - |  18 - 102 ||
|charlson_comorbidity_index| - | 0 - 20 ||
|admission_type_Medical| binary | 0 - 1 ||
|admission_type_ScheduledSurgical| binary | 0 - 1 ||
|admission_type_UnscheduledSurgical| binary | 0 - 1 ||
|icu_expire_flag| binary | 0 - 1 ||
|los| days | 2 - 375 | The lower bound is limited due to the requirements of the model|


## How to reproduce the paper

Create a virtualenv:

`mkvirtualenv <virtual_env_name>`

Install required libraries:

`pip install -r code/requirements.txt`

Create a folder for the data:

`mkdir ./data`

Run the whole pipeline:

`python -m code.pipeline ./data`

Refer to [Test MIMIC dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/alex-pardo/paper1/blob/main/Test%20MIMIC%20dataset.ipynb) for obtaining the AUC ROC curves.

## How to run the models on a different dataset

Create a virtualenv:

`mkvirtualenv <virtual_env_name>`

Install required libraries:

`pip install -r code/requirements.txt`

Refer to [Test custom dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/alex-pardo/paper1/blob/main/Test%20custom%20dataset.ipynb)
