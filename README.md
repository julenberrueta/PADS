## Input data

We used Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) [(Johnson et al. 2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01899-x), a freely available data set to develop PADSthe model. The MIMIC-IV data set was collected from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, containing more than 70k critically ill patients who were admitted to critical care units. It contains patient demographics, vital signs, records of fluid and medication administration, results of laboratory tests, observations, and notes provided by care professionals. Access to MIMIC-IV is provided via [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.1/). The Institutional Review Board at the BIDMC granted a waiver of informed consent and approved the sharing of the research resource.

For this study, we excluded patients with stays shorter than 48 hours (by definition, the proposed models need at least 48 hours worth of data), and those with life support treatment limitation orders.

## Data preprocessing

All the required preprocessing is implemented in the pipeline. It includes:
- NaN imputation (see table below)
- Data normalization

Non-normal values are not checked in the preprocessing phase.

## Variables

The variables used by PADS are the following:


| Variable | Units | Value range | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|stay_id| - | - |The stay ID provided by MIMIC-IV|
|rate_epinephrine| mcg/kg/min | 0 - 4.64 ||
|rate_norepinephrine| mcg/kg/min | 0 - 21.19 ||
|rate_dopamine| mcg/kg/min | 0.2 - 1069.52 ||
|rate_dobutamine| mcg/kg/min | 0.1 - 40.22 ||
|meanbp_min| mmHg | 0.25 - 299 ||
|pao2fio2ratio_novent| - | 8 - 1706 ||
|pao2fio2ratio_vent| - | 1 - 2104 ||

|admission_type_UnscheduledSurgical| binary | 0 - 1 ||
|icu_expire_flag| binary | 0 - 1 ||
|los| days | 2 - 375 | The lower bound is limited due to the requirements of the model|


## Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment with name <virtual_env_name>:

```bash
python -m venv <virtual_env_name>
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
<virtual_env_name>\Scripts\activate
```

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Pipelines

Use the following command to run all the pipelines (you only need to change the `--mode` argument). It is recommended to run the script from the root directory of the project:

```python
python -m code.code_v2 --csv_filename <data_filename> --mode <mode_type>
```

Complete run example with `synthetic_dataset.csv`:

```python
python -m code.code_v2 --csv_filename synthetic_dataset.csv --mode generate_files
python -m code.code_v2 --csv_filename synthetic_dataset.csv --mode generate_retrain_data
python -m code.code_v2 --csv_filename synthetic_dataset.csv --mode retrain_models
python -m code.code_v2 --csv_filename synthetic_dataset.csv --mode calculate_metrics
python -m code.code_v2 --csv_filename synthetic_dataset.csv --mode inference
```

### üîπ Arguments

- `--csv_filename <data_filename>`  
  Path to the input `.csv` file. The file must be located in the `data/` folder.

- `--mode <mode_type>`  
  Specifies the operation mode. Choose one of the following:

### üîß Mode Types

| Mode                    | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `generate_files`        | Generates essential intermediate files used in subsequent steps.            |
| `generate_retrain_data` | Prepares and saves model-ready data (`.pkl`) for mortality and discharge model retraining. |
| `retrain_models`        | Retrains the mortality and discharge models using preprocessed data.        |
| `calculate_metrics`        | Determines optimal thresholds and generates AUC-ROC curves, error plot and confusion matrix plot.        |
| `inference`             | Generates inference plots.                    |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable Parameters in `code_v2.py`

At the bottom of the `code_v2.py` script, you can modify the following parameters to tailor the pipeline:

- **BASE_PATH**

  - The root path of the project. You usually don't need to change this as long as you run the script from the project's root directory.

- **MORT_NORMALIZER**

  - The filename of the normalizer used for the mortality model during retraining and evaluation. 
    - Default: `mimic_iv_normalizer.pkl`. 
    - Custom: `custom_normalizer.pkl` (generated with `--mode generate_files`)

- **DISCH_NORMALIZER**

  - The filename of the normalizer used for the discharge model. 
    - Default: `mimic_iv_normalizer_disch.pkl`.
    - Custom: `custom_normalizer_disch.pkl` (generated with `--mode generate_files`)

- **RETRAIN_TYPE** Defines the retraining strategy. Options include:
  - `zero`: **Train** models from scratch (randomly initialized weights).
  - `full`: Retrain the entire model.
  - `dense`: Retrain dense layers.
  - `lstm`: Retrain the LSTM layers.

- **RETRAIN_MORT_MODEL**: 
  - Name of the mortality model file that will be retrained.
    - Default: `lstm_mortality_model.keras`.

- **RETRAIN_DISCH_MODEL**:
  - Name of the discharge model file that will be retrained.
    - Default: `lstm_discharge_model.keras`.

- **INFERENCE_MORT_MODEL**:
  - Name of the retrained mortality model to be used in inference mode.
    - Example: `RETRAINED_zero_lstm_mortality_model.keras`.

- **INFERENCE_DISCH_MODEL**: 
  - Name of the retrained discharge model to be used in inference mode. 
    - Example: `RETRAINED_zero_lstm_discharge_model.keras`.

- **TEST_TYPE**: Specifies which part of the data is used during inference. Options include:
  - `full`: Uses the full stay.
  - `last_48h`: Uses the last 48 hours of data.
  - `last_98h`: Uses the last 98 hours.
  - `first_48h`: Uses the first 48 hours.
